"""
This module pulls and saves data on fundamentals from CRSP and Compustat.
It pulls fundamentals data from Compustat needed to calculate
book equity, and the data needed from CRSP to calculate market equity.

Note: This code uses the new CRSP CIZ format. Information
about the differences between the SIZ and CIZ format can be found here:

 - Transition FAQ: https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/support/manuals-and-overviews/crsp/stocks-and-indices/crsp-stock-and-indexes-version-2/crsp-ciz-faq/
 - CRSP Metadata Guide: https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/1941/CRSP_METADATA_GUIDE_STOCK_INDEXES_FLAT_FILE_FORMAT_2_0_CIZ_09232022v.pdf

For information about Compustat variables, see:
https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/1583/Compustat_Data_Guide.pdf

For more information about variables in CRSP, see:
https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/396/CRSP_US_Stock_Indices_Data_Descriptions.pdf
I don't think this is updated for the new CIZ format, though.

Here is some information about the old SIZ CRSP format:
